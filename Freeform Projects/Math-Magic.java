This Code first multiplies  in line 4 the integer myNumber with the value 12 and 12, then uses the product plus 12 and divides it with 12. Then, in the 7th line, they use the result plus 17 and minus the original number. In line 9, they divide the result with 6. The method "system.out.println" shows us the result in the console
